####**摘要**：
In constructing the Poincaré section in Figure 3.9 we plotted points only at times that were in phase with the force; that is, at times t≈2πn/Ω_D , where n is an interger. At these values of t the driving force passed throught zero [see (3.8)]. However, we could just as easily have chosen to make the plot at times corresponding to a maximum of the drive force, or at times  π/4 out-of-phase with this force, etc. Construct the Poincaré sections for these cases and compare them with Figure 3.9.  ####
####**背景介绍：**
在Figure3.9中，我们已经绘制t≈2πn/Ω_D时的庞加莱截面，现在，我们考虑与该力差π/4个相位时的情况，并进行对比####
